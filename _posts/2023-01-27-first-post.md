Some ideas that I have for future blog posts are modeling data in either R or Python, walking through some data wrangling tips, or just talking about different fields that data scientists are needed in.

Some of the data ethics books that I am considering reading are Invisible Women, The Ethical Algorithm, and Heartificial Intelligence. These are all books that I've had people recommend to me in the past year, so I think that there is a lot of stuff that I'll be able to learn from them.

The data for my main class project will probably be some sort of data on defense. I've had some opportunities to work with individuals who do a lot with aerospace and defense, and I find this data extremely interesting. I'm not sure where I'm going to get the data from, but this is the direction I'm thinking of going in.
