Hi, I'm Millie! I'm currently a student at BYU studying data science/statistics. I love programming, and I'm working of developing my skills more. I have mostly worked with R and Python, but have some experience with SAS, C++, and directly working into Linux systems.

When I'm not programming and doing school work, I love being outside. I run all year, and in the winter I ski a lot. My favorite thing about living in Utah for school is that I'm so close to the mountains! In addition to this, I love spending time with friends, and I especially love going to concerts with friends.
